# Image-Classification

In this notebook, I train a multi-layer perceptron with two hidden layers and an output layer that uses the softmax activation function to output the probabilities of the labels for the given image. I train the MLP through 15 epochs and achieve an accuracy of 50% on the testing dataset.

I then experiment with a convolutional neural network with 3 convolutional layers, which then leads to a feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer and the same output layer as described above. With the convolutional neural network, which uses a 3x3 filter, I achieve a 70% accuracy on the testing dataset.
